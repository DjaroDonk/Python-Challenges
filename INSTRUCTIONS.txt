        INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------

Open CHALLENGES.txt and choose a challenge you like.
Create a function in work_file.py and make sure it works. 
You are allowed to add variables, functions, classes, etc. as long as you keep the name of the main function the same.
So if you need to create a function 'is_prime()' you have to call that function 'is_prime()', 
but you are allowed to add more functions or global variables that you call trough that function.
Once the function is done you open test.py and enter the id of the challenge you did.
It will now test if the function works. This is why it's important to use the right name.
If it doesn't work it will tell you what doesn't work.
If it works it will tell you it works.
Using the internet to get answers isn't against the rule. 
It's actually recommended, as some challenges use obscure maths.
You are only allowed to use the following modules:
